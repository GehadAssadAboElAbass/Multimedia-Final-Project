    Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s,
	and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.
	It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music.
	Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and 
	other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, 
	and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verseâ€“chorus form, 
	but the genre has become extremely diverse.
	Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.

    Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
	and developed from roots in blues and ragtime.Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become 
	recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by 
	the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation.
	Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. 
	Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, 
	as well as European military band music.
	Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms".

    Folk music includes traditional folk music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century folk revival. 
	Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, 
	music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. 
	It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.

    House music is a genre of electronic dance music created by club DJs and music producers in Chicago in the early 1980s.
	Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms provided by drum machines,[not in citation given] off-beat hi-hat cymbals, 
	and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, which preceded and influenced it,
	as both were DJ and record producer-created dance music, house was more electronic and minimalistic.
	The mechanical, repetitive rhythm of house was one of its main components. Many house compositions were instrumental, with no vocals;
	some had singing throughout the song with lyrics; and some had singing but no actual words.

    Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans 
	in the late 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. 
	It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, 
	break dancing, and graffiti writing.Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), 
	and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. 
	The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; 
	the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.

<h3>MUSIC ©</h3>
<p>
Music is an art form and cultural activity 
whose medium is sound organized in time. 
General definitions of music include common 
elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), 
rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation),
 dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre 
 and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).
